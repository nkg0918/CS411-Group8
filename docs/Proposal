Date planner with budget

This idea is for anyone who wants to take that special person out on a date in their city/town. 
The web app will have a user functionality to it to save previous recommended date nights and view them on the go. 
Once logged in, users will be navigated to a form where they can put in their city that they are in, what type of budget they may have, and the times they want to be out. 
Our app will then recommend certain things to do around the city that fall within your constraints using the yelp api. 
The activities will then be displayed on google maps for the user to view. 
Each time they put in their requirements the data will be randomly generated giving you different things to do each time making sure you get a fresh list of things to do. 
A potential feature we were also considering is making it capable of taking into account the weather when it figures out what you can do in the city.

Web Scraper for News

The idea is to find recent news or updates on famous people you select and email to you. 
The app will make the users input the list of famous people they want to be notified about. 
It will utilize the web scraper api to find the headlines or gossips about famous people and filter the ones that users might like the most.
