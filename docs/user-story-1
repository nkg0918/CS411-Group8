1. If someone uses this app to make a night date plan with a limited budget, this website would generate such a plan for the user. 
Firstly, the user uses his or her google account to log in to use functions. There is a logging page when the user uses this website first. 
After the user logs in, a new page will be assigned to the user and the user can type his idea or requirements in a search box, 
and then the website will process what the user types and generate a date plan based on the userâ€™s requirement. 
The search box consists of a city name(ex. Boston), a time period(9pm~1am), one to two preferences(ex. restaurant, park), 
and a maximum budget($) that the user can take. 
Then, the web returns a date plan for the user which contains recommendations for the user what he can do 
and where to do based on the preference of the user and the location. Simultaneously, the plan calculates the total cost for the user(money, time) and 
generates a route, an order for each step, for the user that makes the whole date more convenient.
