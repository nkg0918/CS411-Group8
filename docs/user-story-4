You want to account for weather when you are planning activities:

If you are a user who wants to plan out a date night that takes into account the weather, you will first head over to the website. You will go from the
landing page to the login screen, and log in using your google credentials. Once you are logged in, you will see a home screen with a form on it where you
can put in your date night criteria. Because you want to account for weather, you must click the button at the top that says “weather”. From there, you can
choose the date that you want the date to be on, although note that we can only plan a date for you 7 days in advance as the website goes off of a week
long weather forecast. After that, you can choose to set a budget for yourself to dictate how expensive or inexpensive the activities will be. You will
then have to choose the time that you want your date to start and finish. Once you have all of that filled you, click the generate button and the website
will generate a list of fun activities for you to do. From there you can choose which activities you actually want to do out of those, and it will save
them for you to view later.
